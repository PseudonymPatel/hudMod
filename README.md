# keyCounter
This is a simple forge mod that adds a couple nifty "features" for ppl, like counting the number of jumps.
Move around the jump counter with `/keyc set xPos <number>` or `/keyc set yPos <number>`

a mod just for myself, put on github just because

next update I plan to make feature to trace path taken so you can see how you did a parkour and where you could improve.
